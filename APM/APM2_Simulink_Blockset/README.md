# APM2_Simulink_Blockset

>Simulink blockset has been developed that will allow students to work solely in Matlab/Simulink for the development of GNC code. This code can be downloaded directly to the ArduPilot 2.0 integrated sensor and processing package allowing the students to easily develop small unmanned aerial vehicles. The blockset is useful in that it eliminates the requirement to have a knowledgeable programmer, and a knowledgeable electrical engineer to integrate hardware and software with the airframe.
